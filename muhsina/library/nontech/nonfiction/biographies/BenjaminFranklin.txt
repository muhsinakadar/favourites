continents. Depending on the convention and model, some continents may be consolidated or s
ubdivided: for example, Eurasia is often

 subdivided into [[Europe] and Asia (red shades), while North and South America are
 sometimes reckoned as one American continent (green

A continent is one of several large landmasses on Earth. They are generally identified 
by convention rather than any strict criteria,

 but seven areas are commonly recognised as continents (in descending order of size): Asia, Africa,
 North America, South America,

 Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.

Plate tectonics is the geological process and study of the movement, collision and division of
 continents, earlier known as continental

 drift.

The term "the Continent" (capitalized), used predominantly in the European isles, 
such as the British Isles, Sardinia and Sicily, means

 mainland Europe, although it can also mean Asia when said in Japan.

"Continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally 
separated by expanses of water."[1] However, many

 of the seven most commonly recognized continents are identified by convention rather
 than adherence to the ideal criterion that each b

e a discrete landmass, separated by water from others. Likewise, the criterion that 
each be a continuous landmass is often disregarded

 by the inclusion of the continental shelf and oceanic islands. Relatedly, the Earth's major 
landmasses are washed upon by a single,

 continuous World Ocean, which is subdivided into a number of principal oceanic components by the 
continents and various geographic

 criteria.[2][3]


Extent of continents

The narrowest meaning of continent is that of a continuous[4] area of land or mainland, with the
 coastline and any land boundaries

 forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe is used to refer to 
mainland Europe, excluding islands

 such as Great Britain, Ireland, and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the 
mainland of Australia, excluding

 Tasmania. Similarly, the continental United States may refer to the 48 contiguous United States in
 central North America, may or may

 not include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (both separated by Canada), while excluding 
Hawaii in the middle of the Pacific

 Ocean.

From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines o
f continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[5] and 
the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[6] 
From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines 
vary with changes in sea level.[7] In this sense the British Isles are part of Europe, and Australia and 
the island of New Guinea together form a continent (Australia-New Guinea).

As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic 
islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland may be considered part of Europe and Madagascar part 
of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers take Australia and all the islands of 
Oceania (or sometimes Australasia) to be equivalent to a continent, allowing the entire land surface of the 
Earth to be divided into continents or quasi-continents.[8]
Separation of continents

The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly disregarded in favor of more 
arbitrary, historical conventions. Of the seven most commonly recognized continents, only Antarctica and 
Australia are separated from other continents.

Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as "more or less discrete masses of 
land".[9] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus 
of Panama. Both these isthmuses are very narrow in comparison with the bulk of the landmasses they join, a
nd both are transected by artificial canals (the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, respectively) which effectively 
separate these landmasses.

The division of the landmass of Eurasia into the separate continents of Asia and Europe is an anomaly with no basis in physical geography. The separation is maintained for historical and cultural reasons. An alternative view is that Eurasia is a single continent, one of six continents in total. This view is held by some geographers and is preferred in Russia (which spans Asia and Europe).

North America and South America are now treated as separate continents in much of Western Europe, China, and most native English-speaking countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Furthermore, the concept of two American continents is prevalent in much of Asia. However in earlier times they were viewed as a single continent known as America or, to avoid ambiguity with the United States of America, as the Americas. However, the plurality of this last term suggests that even in these "earlier times" some considered the New World (the Americas) as two separate continents. North and South America are viewed as a single continent, one of six in total, in Iberia, Italy, Israel, some other parts of Europe, and much of Latin America.

When continents are defined as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Asia, Europe and Africa form a single continent known by various names such as Africa-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Africa-Eurasia, the Americas, Antarctica and Australia.

When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At this time Australia-New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise North America and Asia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Africa-Eurasia-America, Antarctica and Australia-New Guinea.
